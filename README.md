Use of Drones for Potholes Detection
In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
Degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and Computer Science 

Birdseye is a system consisting of 3 components: Flight-ready Drone equipped with an 8 Megapixel Camera, Machine
Learning Algorithm that detects potholes, a Mobile Application that displays geo-tagged potholes using Google Maps
API. The system surveys roads and automatically detects and stores the locations of potholes in itsvicinity. Then, the
application displays tagged potholes using its interface for the user.The application is also capable of navigating the
